# iot-manager Frontend
I was considering to do a react web page, but after a second thought, that maybe the controller is not a person, instead that is a programable pannel. So I have determined to use the Postman to interact wtih our api. The postman record is in iotRegistryApi.postman_collection.json, and feel free to import it.
